Home Screen Findings
 - Displaying categories icons makes the app atractive at first glance but is a bit confusing what they mean and their purpouse until one of them is pressed
 - Displaying the current date is really helpful, however i would had expected that taping on it allowed me to show a calendar and select the date I would like to navigate to
 - Displaying the income and expenses at the centers are quite useful but it would be more useful to also show the remaining balance
 - displaying the expenses within a circular chart helps visualize the expenses, I would had expected to be able to modify the expense/income by pressing the labels
 - The icons for adding income expense can be confuising, the plus (+) button in green can be understood as to add an operation not necesarly as an income, in similar fashion the minus (-) button in red, can be understood as to remove an opperation not necesarly as an expense.

Balance screen Findings
 - Showing the icons and the categories is helpful
 - It would be expected to be able to tap and drag an expense to the left to display a trash icon to remove the expense/income instead of having to tap move into the edit expense/income screen

Income/Expense input findings,
 - At first glance is strange to see a full calculator when trying to input the amount, I would consider this as a bug
 - Is not possible to switch the account after opening the recurring screen

Bug
- Exporting data to a file within the same device is not possible as there is no way to complete the action
- Restoring the financial data through the backup file is confiusing, after pressing the restore data option, a list seems to popup floating without any context,
- Clearing the data also removes the selected currency
- pressing and holding a category icon displays the amount spend within the circular chart however releasing the press always takes you to the input expense screen, is not clear how long do i need to keep the hold to prevent this from happening



Prioritisation
As the app aim is to help users to track their spendings, the screens with the highest impact would be the home screen, the balance and income/expense input screens as this are the key items in a tracker, after this the features helping reporting would be the second most important example of this are the filters and search options. Finally customization would be the next area I would focus on, during the exploration, it seems that is not possible to delete categories and creating new ones is only possible for premium users.

Risks
the main risks for this application would be security and consistency.

Security, as the app is for tracking financial information, this is considered sensible data and therefore some security layer should be added (seems to be present within the payed version - not verified) while trying to open the app or export the information through a csv file.

Consistency, the app seems to be aiming at handling multiple currencies and accounts which means that we must ensure to track both items correctly.
