As we are testing an API, based on functionality I would recommend to automate the test of it in the following way.

1. User
    a) [POST]    Create user            [/user]
    b) [GET]     Get user by user_name  [/user/{username}]
    c) [GET]     User login             [/user/login]
    d) [GET]     User logout            [/user/logout]
    e) [DELETE]  User delete            [/user/{username}]
    f) [PUT]     User update            [/user/{username}] -> not automated as endpoint is currently buggy and perform the same action as DELETE

2. Store
    a) [POST]    Place Order            [/store/order]
    b) [GET]     Get order by id        [/store/order/{orderId}]
    c) [DELETE]  Delete order           [/store/order/{orderId}]

3. Pet
    a) [POST]    Create pet             [/pet]
    b) [GET]     Get pet by id          [/pet/{petId}]
    c) [DELETE]  Delete Pet             [/pet/{petId}]
